# Canvas Notify

I was bored, so I made a program to quickly check when my assignments are due.  
To configure for your account create an API Token in Canvas.  

Create a file called ".env" and paste in your token like so:  
API_TOKEN=[PASTE TOKEN HERE]
  
If you are from a different school swap out the URL with your school's canvas URL:  
'https://[REPLACE ME]/api/graphql'  

Happy Procrastinating!
